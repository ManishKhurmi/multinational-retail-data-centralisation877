## To-do's
- Task 3: extract and clean the user data. After cleaning rows are currently 15299 when they should be 15284
- M2T4: in the card_data -> the 'card_number' when removing non numeric, removes 51 rows. This means we are left with 15258, however Ai Core mentions the total after all filtering is 15284, check with engineers 

#Â MK: M2T4 -> clean_card_data -> data_cleaning.py
